# About Me


I have designed, supported, and managed infrastructure to host SaaS solutions in the healthcare and telecommunication industry that meets regulatory requirements posed by HIPAA and SOC-II. 

I have experience supporting and maintaining the infrastructure that processes network traffic of 45 million texts a day. I love documenting my work to share what I know. I believe and have seen first hand how lack of standard processes brings chaos and losses to businesses and so if there isn't a process i work with necessary stakeholders to devise/enforce the standard operating procedures, I try to identify bottlenecks or gaps and drive the initiatives to fill them. I have been/can be a Team player/All-In-One operations player, depending on what my job requires me to be. 

I am looking for new opportunities that help me design, manage, and support infrastructure that operates on a scale of billion transactions a day, and demands multi-region availability.
